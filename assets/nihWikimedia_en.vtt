00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>The national institutes of health and the wikimedia foundation are joining</v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.440
forces to improve online health information.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.980
<v 1>We want to place our information in places where people actually look for it</v>

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.843
and get it.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.650
<v 0>John Berkeley is the NIH associate director for communications and public</v>

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.484
liaison.

7
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.300
<v 1>Quite simply, NIH provides reliable health information.</v>

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.310
That's based on evidence and is of the highest quality and Wikipedia is the

9
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.180
go-to source for hundreds of millions of people around the world looking for

10
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:33.014
information,

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.520
it made perfect sense for our organizations to get to know each other better and

12
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.360
learn how we can collaborate to reach more people with the best information

13
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:44.600
available on their health and medical questions.

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.820
<v 0>NIH hosted Wikimedia staff and volunteers working in the sciences for</v>

15
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.810
an all day event.

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.880
Participants learned about the philosophy and mechanics of Wikipedia and

17
00:00:55.881 --> 00:01:00.320
began what is hoped to be a long-term dialogue aimed at improving public

18
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.140
knowledge about health science and medicine.

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
Adrian [inaudible] is a teaching fellow at Indiana university and a member

20
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.130
of Wikipedias Academy team.

21
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.320
<v 2>We came to the NIH because Wikipedia doesn't just want to rely on people who</v>

22
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.860
voluntarily come to us just because they click on a button.

23
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.140
We actually want to go out into the world and say,

24
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.110
this is what's wonderful about Wikipedia, and we want you to contribute.

25
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.520
So this is the first time we've done one of these academies inside the United

26
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.521
States,

27
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:33.140
but they've already been done in Europe and we've had a great response to them.

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.750
You know, you have to go out into the world and say, you know,

29
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.930
this is what's wonderful. Come help us come help us, you know,

30
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.270
bring knowledge to everyone on the planet.

31
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.900
<v 0>Wikipedia academies are public outreach events,</v>

32
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.790
usually lasting one or two days aimed at engaging academics and

33
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.350
other subject matter experts who are not familiar with the wiki culture or

34
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:57.020
online communitie. Olaf Leonhard Gulbransson,

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.940
president of Wikimedia Sweden says this collaboration provides a great

36
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.530
opportunity for increasing the quality of all health-related information on

37
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:07.364
Wikipedia.

38
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.730
<v 3>We have several different expectations of this.</v>

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.030
One of which is to raise the quality of Wikipedia.

40
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.050
We hope to increase the number of scientists and web authors,

41
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.940
and also start a collaboration of content between the

42
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:27.710
Wikipedia and the various "We give media" projects and the NIH

43
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:29.600
and its various branches.

44
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.820
<v 0>The Wikimedia foundation is a nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia</v>

45
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:38.690
online encyclopedia to view the NIH page on Wikipedia,

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.590
