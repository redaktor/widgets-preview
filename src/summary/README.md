# @dojo/widgets/button

Dojo's `Button` widget creates a `<button>` element with support `pressed` and `disabled` states.

## Features

- Provides an API for valid `<button>` attributes
- Can be used to create a toggle button (i.e. a button with an on/off state)

### Accessibility Features

- The basic button provides a strongly typed `type` property, as well as `disabled`
- Setting `pressed` to create a toggle button handles `aria-pressed`
