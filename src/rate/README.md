# Rate widget

Star rating widget. Allows the user to specify the number of stars to display as well as allowing half stars.
When setting a `value` or `initialValue` the value will be rounded to the nearest appropriate value.
When specifying an `icon` to be used in place of the star this icon must be a font icon that can be coloured via a `color` css rule or an svg that can be coloured via a `fill` css rule.
